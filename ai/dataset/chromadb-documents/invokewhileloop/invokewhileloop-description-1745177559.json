Purpose\r\n\r\nThe InvokeWhileLoop plugin runs actions repeatedly while a specified condition remains true and stops when the condition becomes false. It adapts to changing situations during execution and stops automatically if it takes too long. It also records data and performance details for each iteration.\r\n\r\n### Key Features and Functionality\r\n\r\n| Feature                      | Description                                                         |\r\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Dynamic Iteration            | Runs steps in a loop that adapts to changing conditions at runtime. |\r\n| Conditional Execution        | Continues looping while your specified condition remains true.      |\r\n| Timeout Handling             | Stops the loop automatically if it exceeds a set time limit.        |\r\n| Execution Insights           | Records data and performance details during each iteration.         |\r\n\r\n### Usages in RPA\r\n\r\n| Use Case                   | Description                                                     |\r\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Data Validation            | Checks data repeatedly until it meets your criteria.            |\r\n| Dynamic Process Automation | Automatically repeats tasks based on live conditions.           |\r\n| Conditional Flow Control   | Lets scripts change course by checking conditions during a run. |\r\n\r\n### Usages in Automation Testing\r\n\r\n| Use Case                   | Description                                                    |\r\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Dynamic Testing            | Keeps testing until the application reaches the desired state. |\r\n| Repetitive Task Automation | Repeats test steps until a condition is satisfied.             |\r\n| Conditional Flow Testing   | Allows tests to adapt on the fly based on changing conditions. |"]}
