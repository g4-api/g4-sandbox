Purpose\r\n\r\nThe InvokeForLoop plugin runs a set of actions a specified number of times in your automation scripts. It makes repeating tasks simple by letting you define exactly how many loops to perform. This saves time and effort when you need predictable, repeated steps. It works equally well in RPA workflows and automated tests.\r\n\r\n### Key Features and Functionality\r\n\r\n| Feature                 | Description                                                             |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Controlled Iteration    | Runs actions for a fixed number of loops as defined by the user.        |\r\n| Sequential Execution    | Executes each step in order within the loop for consistent outcomes.    |\r\n| Parameterized Iteration | Adjusts loop variables dynamically based on input values or conditions. |\r\n\r\n### Usages in RPA\r\n\r\n| Use Case                | Description                                                           |\r\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Data Processing         | Iterate over records or items to enter, validate, or transform data.  |\r\n| Batch Processing        | Perform a series of tasks on a predefined data set within a workflow. |\r\n| Parameterized Iteration | Change loop values at runtime to handle varying input automatically.  |\r\n\r\n### Usages in Automation Testing\r\n\r\n| Use Case            | Description                                                                          |\r\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Test Case Iteration | Run test steps repeatedly to cover multiple scenarios.                               |\r\n| Data-Driven Testing | Loop through different data sets to verify application behavior under varied inputs. |\r\n| Load Testing        | Simulate repeated user actions to measure system performance under load.             |"]}
