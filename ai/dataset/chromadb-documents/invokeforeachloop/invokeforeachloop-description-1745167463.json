Purpose\r\n\r\nThe InvokeForEachLoop plugin finds all elements matching your locator and runs a set of actions on each one. To operate on the entire collection, set onElement to \".\" and omit the locator. You can also specify a different locator to decide where actions take place. It supports nested loops for multi-level workflows, making it easier to automate repetitive tasks in RPA and automated testing.\r\n\r\n### Key Features and Functionality\r\n\r\n| Feature                     | Description                                                         |\r\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Element Iteration           | Finds all elements matching the locator and loops through each one. |\r\n| Sequential Execution        | Runs actions in order on each element for a clear workflow.         |\r\n| Alternative Locator Support | Lets you specify a different locator for where actions run.         |\r\n| Nested Loop Capability      | Allows loops inside loops for multi-level workflows.                |\r\n\r\n### Usages in RPA\r\n\r\n| Use Case            | Description                                                                       |\r\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Data Processing     | Process each item in a list by running data entry, validation, or transformation. |\r\n| Batch Operations    | Perform a series of tasks on groups of files, records, or transactions in order.  |\r\n| Dynamic Interaction | Work with UI items created at runtime by clicking, typing, or checking content.   |\r\n\r\n### Usages in Automation Testing\r\n\r\n| Use Case               | Description                                                                 |\r\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Element Verification   | Check each UI element to confirm its state or value matches expectations.   |\r\n| Data-Driven Testing    | Run tests across different data sets by looping through inputs and actions. |\r\n| UI Interaction Testing | Simulate user steps like clicks or form entries on each element.            |"]}
