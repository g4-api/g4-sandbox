Purpose\r\n\r\nThe CopyParameter plugin helps move values from one parameter to another within automation scripts. It makes it easy to share data between steps by copying values across different scopes. You can set or rely on default source and target scopes to keep your data organized. This ensures that scripts run smoothly with the right information in the right place.\r\n\r\n### Key Features and Functionality\r\n\r\n| Feature               | Description                                                                         |\r\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Copy Parameter Values | Moves a parameter\u0027s value from a source location to a target location.              |\r\n| Scope Management      | Lets you specify or default source and target scopes for parameters.                |\r\n| Environment Support   | Retrieves and sets parameters in various environments, including application scope. |\r\n\r\n### Usages in RPA\r\n\r\n| Use Case                  | Description                                                     |\r\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Data Transfer             | Share data between script steps by copying parameter values.    |\r\n| Session Management        | Propagate session-specific values to maintain consistent state. |\r\n| Parameter Synchronization | Keep parameters in sync across different automation components. |\r\n\r\n### Usages in Automation Testing\r\n\r\n| Use Case           | Description                                                  |\r\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Test Data Handling | Copy values between test cases or steps to set up test data. |\r\n| Environment Setup  | Move configuration parameters to prepare test environments.  |\r\n| Dynamic Test Runs  | Transfer runtime values to support varied test scenarios.    |"]}
