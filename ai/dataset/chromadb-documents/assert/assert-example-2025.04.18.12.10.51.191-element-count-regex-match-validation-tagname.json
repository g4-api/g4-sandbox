element count is a positive integer using the Match operator.  \nIf the element count matches the regex pattern, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the number of button elements matches a positive integer pattern  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify element count matches regex pattern  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementCount - Checks the count of elements found  \n    - **Operator**: Match - Uses regex matching for validation  \n    - **Expected**: ^[1-9][0-9]*$ - Regex pattern for positive integers  \n- **Locator**: TagName  \n- **On Element**: button  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementCount --Operator:Match
