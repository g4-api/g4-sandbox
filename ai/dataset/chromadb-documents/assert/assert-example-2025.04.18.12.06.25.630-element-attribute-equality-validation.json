demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element equals a given value.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element identified by the CSS selector `#elementId` is equal to `0` using the Equal operator.  \nIf the attribute value exactly equals `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s attribute

value of an element  \n    - **Operator**: Equal - Compares attribute value for equality  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The expected attribute value to match  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: #elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$
