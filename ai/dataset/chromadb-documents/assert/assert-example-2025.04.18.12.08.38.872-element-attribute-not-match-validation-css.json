fails to conform to the pattern using the NotMatch operator.  \nIf the attribute value does not match the regex pattern, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the

  - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: NotMatch - Asserts the attribute value does not match the pattern  \n    - **Expected**: ^[a-zA-Z]+$ - The regex pattern the attribute should not match  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: #elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule
