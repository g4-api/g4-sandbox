Attribute Lower Validation Using Id\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is lower than a given value using the Id locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element with Id `elementId` is lower than `0` using the Lower operator.  \nIf the attribute value is lower than `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the attribute \u0027index\u0027 of a specified element is less than zero  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute comparison is lower than expected value  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an element\u0027s attribute value  \n    - **Operator**: Lower - Compares if the attribute value is less than the expected  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The value to compare the attribute against  \n- **Locator**: Id  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule
