Xpath\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that the attribute `index` of an element matches the regex pattern `^\\d+$`.  \nIt asserts that the attribute value conforms to the pattern using the Match operator with an Xpath locator.  \nIf the attribute value matches the regex pattern, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s \u0027index\u0027 attribute matches a numeric pattern using regex  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute matches regex pattern  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks a specific attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: Match - Uses regex matching to compare values  \n    - **Expected**: ^\\d+$ - The regex pattern that the attribute value must match (one or more digits)  \n- **Locator**: Xpath  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: //*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule
