the pattern using the Match operator.  \nIf the attribute value matches the regex pattern, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s \u0027index\u0027 attribute matches a numeric pattern  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Validate element attribute with regex match  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute of a specified element  \n    - **Operator**: Match - Uses regex matching to compare values  \n    - **Expected**: ^\\d+$ - The regex pattern that the attribute value must match (digits only)  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: #elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n
