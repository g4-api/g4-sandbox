Verify element count is lower than expected  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementCount - Checks the number of matching elements  \n    - **Operator**: Lower - Compares if the count is less than the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 2 - The threshold number of elements to compare against  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Element**: .primary-button  \n- **Plugin Name**:
