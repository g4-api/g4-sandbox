Xpath\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is not equal to a given value using the NotEqual operator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element identified by the Xpath selector `//*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]` is not equal to `0`.  \nIf the attribute value does not equal `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s attribute \u0027index\u0027 is not equal to 0  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute value is not equal to
