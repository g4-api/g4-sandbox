Xpath\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element equals a given value using the Xpath locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element identified by the Xpath `//*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]` is equal to `0` using the Equal operator.  \nIf the attribute value exactly equals `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Verify that the element\u0027s attribute equals the expected value  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Check if an element attribute equals a specific value  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks the value of a specified attribute on an element  \n    - **Operator**: Equal - Compares the attribute value for equality  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The expected attribute value to compare against  \n- **Locator**: Xpath  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: //*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation
