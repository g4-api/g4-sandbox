Element Attribute Equality Validation Using Id\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element equals a given value using the Id locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element with Id `elementId` is equal to `0` using the Equal operator.  \nIf the attribute value exactly equals `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the attribute \u0027index\u0027 of the element with Id \u0027elementId\u0027 equals 0  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute equality with expected value 0  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an element\u0027s attribute value  \n    - **Operator**: Equal - Compares attribute value for equality  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The expected attribute value to match  \n- **Locator**: Id  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule
