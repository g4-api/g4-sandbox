element with Id `elementId` fails to conform to the pattern using the NotMatch operator.  \nIf the attribute value does not match the regex pattern, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s attribute value does not match the specified regex pattern  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute does not match regex pattern  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: NotMatch - Asserts the attribute value does not match the pattern  \n    - **Expected**: ^[a-zA-Z]+$ - The regex pattern the attribute value should not match  \n- **Locator**: Id  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert
