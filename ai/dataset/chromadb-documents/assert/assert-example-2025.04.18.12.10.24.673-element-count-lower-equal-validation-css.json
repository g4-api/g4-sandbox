element count is lower or equal to 2  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementCount - Checks how many elements match the locator  \n    - **Operator**: LowerEqual - Verifies the count is less than or equal to the expected number  \n    - **Expected**: 2 - The maximum allowed number of matching elements  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Element**: .primary-button  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementCount --Operator:LowerEqual --Expected:2}}\",\n  \"locator\":
