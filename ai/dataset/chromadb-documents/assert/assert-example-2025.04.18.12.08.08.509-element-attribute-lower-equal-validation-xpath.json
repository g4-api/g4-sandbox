Xpath\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is lower than or equal to a given value using the Xpath locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element identified by the Xpath selector `//*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]` is lower than or equal to `0` using the LowerEqual operator.  \nIf the attribute value is lower than or equal to `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s attribute value is less than or equal to zero  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute comparison with LowerEqual operator  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute value of an element  \n    - **Operator**: LowerEqual - Verifies the attribute is less than or equal to the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The value to compare the attribute against  \n- **Locator**: Xpath  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: //*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementAttribute
