CssSelector\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that the element count for the selector `.primary-button` matches the regex pattern `^[1-9][0-9]*$`.  \nIt asserts that the element count is a positive integer using the Match operator.  \nIf the element count matches the regex pattern, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the number of elements matching `.primary-button` is a positive integer  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify element count matches a regex pattern  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementCount - Checks how many elements match the locator  \n    - **Operator**: Match - Uses regex matching for the count  \n    - **Expected**: ^[1-9][0-9]*$ - The regex pattern for a positive integer  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Element**: .primary-button  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$
