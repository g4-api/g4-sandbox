Xpath\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is greater than a given value using the Xpath locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element identified by the Xpath selector `//*[@id=\u0027elementId\u0027]` is greater than `0` using the Greater operator.  \nIf the attribute value is greater than `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Verify that the element\u0027s attribute value is greater than zero  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n- **Argument**: Check if an element attribute meets a condition  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks a specific attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: Greater - Tests if the attribute value is greater than the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The value to compare the attribute against  \n- **Locator**: Xpath  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**:
