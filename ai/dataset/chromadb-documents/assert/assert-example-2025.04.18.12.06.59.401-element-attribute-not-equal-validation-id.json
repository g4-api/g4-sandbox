Element Attribute NotEqual Validation Using Id\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is not equal to a given value using the NotEqual operator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element with Id `elementId` is not equal to `0`.  \nIf the attribute value does not equal `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the attribute \u0027index\u0027 of the element with Id \u0027elementId\u0027 is not equal to 0  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute is not equal to expected value  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: NotEqual - Confirms the attribute value is not equal to the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The value that the attribute should not equal  \n- **Locator**: Id  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementAttribute --Operator:NotEqual --Expected:0}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"Id\",\n  \"onAttribute\":
