Id\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is lower than or equal to a given value using the Id locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element with Id `elementId` is lower than or equal to `0` using the LowerEqual operator.  \nIf the attribute value is lower than or equal to `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s attribute value is less than or equal to a specified number  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Check if an element attribute is lower or equal to a value  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: LowerEqual - Verifies the attribute is less than or equal to the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The value to compare the attribute against  \n- **Locator**: Id  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert
