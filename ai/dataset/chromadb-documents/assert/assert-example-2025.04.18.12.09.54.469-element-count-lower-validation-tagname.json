Lower Validation Using TagName\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that the number of elements matching the TagName selector for `button` is lower than 2.  \nIf the element

lower than expected  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementCount - Checks the count of elements matching a locator  \n    - **Operator**: Lower - Compares if the actual count is less than the expected count  \n    - **Expected**: 2 - The threshold number to compare against  \n- **Locator**: TagName  \n- **On Element**: button  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule
