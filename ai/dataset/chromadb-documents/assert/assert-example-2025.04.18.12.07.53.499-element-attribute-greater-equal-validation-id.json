Id\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is greater than or equal to a given value using the Id locator.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element with Id `elementId` is greater than or equal to `0` using the GreaterEqual operator.  \nIf the attribute value is greater than or equal to `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check if an element\u0027s attribute value is greater than or equal to a specified number  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify attribute comparison with GreaterEqual operator  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute value of an element  \n    - **Operator**: GreaterEqual - Compares if the attribute value is greater than or equal to the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The minimum value expected for the attribute  \n- **Locator**: Id  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\": \"Action\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementAttribute --Operator:GreaterEqual --Expected:0}}\",\n
