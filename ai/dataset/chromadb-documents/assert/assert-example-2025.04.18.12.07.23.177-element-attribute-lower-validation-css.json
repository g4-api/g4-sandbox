CssSelector\n\nThis example demonstrates how the Assert plugin verifies that a specified attribute of an element is lower than a given value.  \nIt asserts that the attribute `index` of the element identified by the CSS selector `#elementId` is lower than `0` using the Lower operator.  \nIf the attribute value is lower than `0`, the assert evaluates to `true`.\n\n- **Rule Purpose**: Check that the element\u0027s attribute value is less than zero  \n- **Type**: Action  \n- **Argument**: Verify that an element attribute is lower than a specified value  \n  - **Parameters**:  \n    - **Condition**: ElementAttribute - Checks an attribute of an element  \n    - **Operator**: Lower - Compares if the attribute is less than the expected value  \n    - **Expected**: 0 - The value to compare against  \n- **Locator**: CssSelector  \n- **On Attribute**: index  \n- **On Element**: #elementId  \n- **Plugin Name**: Assert  \n\n#### Automation Rule (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$type\":
