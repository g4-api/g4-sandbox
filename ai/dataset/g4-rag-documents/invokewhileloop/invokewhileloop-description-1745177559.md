### Purpose

The InvokeWhileLoop plugin runs actions repeatedly while a specified condition remains true and stops when the condition becomes false. It adapts to changing situations during execution and stops automatically if it takes too long. It also records data and performance details for each iteration.

### Key Features and Functionality

| Feature                      | Description                                                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dynamic Iteration            | Runs steps in a loop that adapts to changing conditions at runtime. |
| Conditional Execution        | Continues looping while your specified condition remains true.      |
| Timeout Handling             | Stops the loop automatically if it exceeds a set time limit.        |
| Execution Insights           | Records data and performance details during each iteration.         |
