Question: What should I consider when setting parameters for the Assert plugin?
Answer: Ensure that the 'Condition', 'Expected', and 'Operator' parameters are clearly defined and aligned with your validation logic. Use accurate element selectors and, if needed, regular expressions to extract and compare values effectively.
