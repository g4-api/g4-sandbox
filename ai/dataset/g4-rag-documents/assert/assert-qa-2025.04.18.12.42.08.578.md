Question: What is the assert rule schema?
Answer: The assert rule schema defines the structure for specifying validation rules used by the Assert plugin. It outlines fields such as 'argument', 'onElement', 'onAttribute', 'locator', 'regularExpression', and 'pluginName' to clearly describe how an assertion should be performed.
