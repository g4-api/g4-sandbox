{"id":"MoveUser32MouseQnA","resource_id":"MoveUser32MouseQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How do I move the mouse cursor to absolute coordinates on the viewport?","answer":"You can move the mouse cursor to absolute viewport coordinates by using the parameters `X` and `Y`. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:300 --Y:400}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveUser32Mouse\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the `OffsetX` and `OffsetY` parameters?","answer":"The `OffsetX` and `OffsetY` parameters specify the horizontal and vertical offsets (in pixels) to adjust the mouse position relative to a target UI element or the last known mouse pointer location."},{"question":"Can I move the mouse relative to a specific UI element?","answer":"Yes, you can move the mouse relative to a specific UI element by using the `OnElement` property with an appropriate locator. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --OffsetX:15 --OffsetY:25 --Alignment:BottomCenter}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"Xpath\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//div[@id=\u0027InteractiveArea\u0027]\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveUser32Mouse\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I do not provide a target UI element?","answer":"If you do not provide a target UI element, the mouse will move relative to the last known mouse pointer location using the specified offsets."},{"question":"What locator strategies can I use with this plugin?","answer":"The `MoveUser32Mouse` plugin supports the `Xpath` locator strategy for identifying UI elements."},{"question":"How does the `Alignment` parameter affect mouse positioning?","answer":"The `Alignment` parameter defines how the mouse is positioned relative to the target UI element. For example, if you set `Alignment` to `BottomCenter`, the mouse will be positioned at the bottom center of the specified element."},{"question":"What will happen if I provide an invalid XPath in the `OnElement` property?","answer":"If you provide an invalid XPath in the `OnElement` property, the plugin will not be able to locate the UI element, and the mouse movement will fail."},{"question":"Can I use the plugin for desktop automation?","answer":"Yes, the `MoveUser32Mouse` plugin is designed for desktop automation, allowing you to control the mouse position for native desktop applications."},{"question":"How can I simulate user interactions in UI testing using this plugin?","answer":"You can simulate user interactions by moving the mouse to specific areas of the screen or within UI elements using absolute or relative coordinates.
