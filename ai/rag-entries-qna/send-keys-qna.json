{"id":"SendKeysQnA","resource_id":"SendKeysQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How can I send the text \u0027Hello World\u0027 to an HTML element using a CSS selector?","answer":"You can use the following configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"Hello World\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I want to clear the input field before sending text?","answer":"You can include the `--Clear` parameter in your argument:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Keys:Hello World --Clear}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do I introduce a delay between each character when sending text?","answer":"You can specify a delay using the `--Delay` parameter:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Keys:Hello World --Delay:2000}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"Can I send text with modifier keys like Shift or Ctrl?","answer":"Yes, you can send text while holding down modifier keys. For example, to send \u0027Hello\u0027 with the Shift key:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Keys:Hello --Modifier:Shift}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What if I use an invalid locator strategy?","answer":"If an invalid locator is used, the plugin will fail to locate the element and will not execute the text input action. Ensure that the locator is valid and correctly identifies the target element."},{"question":"How do I use the NativeClear functionality before sending text?","answer":"You can use the `--NativeClear` parameter to clear the input field natively:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Keys:Hello World --NativeClear}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the \u0027onElement\u0027 property?","answer":"The \u0027onElement\u0027 property specifies the target element where the text inputs will be simulated. It is mandatory and must correctly identify the element to ensure the text is sent to the right location."},{"question":"Can I send text to an element using Xpath?","answer":"Yes, you can use Xpath as a locator strategy. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"Hello World\",\n  \"locator\": \"Xpath\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//input[@id=\u0027TextInput\u0027]\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How does the \u0027Delay\u0027 parameter affect the text input simulation?","answer":"The \u0027Delay\u0027 parameter introduces a pause between each simulated keyboard action, allowing for a more human-like interaction. This can help in scenarios where timing is crucial for the application to process inputs correctly."},{"question":"What are some use cases for the SendKeys plugin?","answer":"The SendKeys plugin can be used for:\n- Simulating user text input in web forms\n- Automating data entry tasks\n- Triggering keyboard events for testing\n- Verifying UI stability after text inputs\n- Testing event handling in applications."}],"text":"# SendKeys Plugin QnA\n\n**How can I send the text \u0027Hello World\u0027 to an HTML element using a CSS selector?**\n\nYou can use the following configuration:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"Hello World\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```\n\n**What happens if I want to clear the input field before sending text?**\n\nYou can include the `--Clear` parameter in your argument:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Keys:Hello World --Clear}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```\n\n**How do I introduce a delay between each character when sending text?**\n\nYou can specify a delay using the `--Delay` parameter:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Keys:Hello World --Delay:2000}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TextInput\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```\n\n**Can I send text with modifier keys like Shift or Ctrl?**\n\nYes, you can send text while holding down modifier keys.
