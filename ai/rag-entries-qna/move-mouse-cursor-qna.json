{"id":"MoveMouseCursorQnA","resource_id":"MoveMouseCursorQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How can I move the mouse cursor to a specific web element using a CSS selector?","answer":"You can move the mouse cursor to a web element identified by the CSS selector `#TargetElement` using the following command:\n```json\n{\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#TargetElement\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveMouseCursor\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What command would I use to move the mouse cursor to specific coordinates (100, 200) on the page?","answer":"To move the mouse cursor to the coordinates (100, 200), you can use the following command:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:100 --Y:200}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveMouseCursor\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do I reset the mouse cursor position to the top-left corner of the page?","answer":"You can reset the mouse cursor position to the top-left corner (coordinates 0, 0) using this command:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:0 --Y:0}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveMouseCursor\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the effect of setting the origin to \u0027Pointer\u0027 when moving the mouse cursor?","answer":"Setting the origin to \u0027Pointer\u0027 means that the movement will be relative to the current position of the mouse cursor. For example, to move the cursor to (300, 400) relative to its current position, you would use:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:300 --Y:400 --Origin:Pointer}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveMouseCursor\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How can I ensure that the mouse cursor movement is relative to the top-left corner of the viewport?","answer":"To move the mouse cursor to (300, 400) relative to the top-left corner of the viewport, you can use the following command:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:300 --Y:400 --Origin:Viewport}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"MoveMouseCursor\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I try to move the mouse cursor without specifying the X and Y coordinates?","answer":"If you do not specify the X and Y coordinates, the command will not execute properly, and you may encounter an error indicating that mandatory parameters are missing."},{"question":"Can I use Xpath as a locator strategy for moving the mouse cursor?","answer":"Yes, you can use Xpath as a locator strategy.
