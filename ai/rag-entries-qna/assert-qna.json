{"id":"AssertQnA","resource_id":"AssertQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How can I assert that the text condition equals \u0027Success\u0027 using the Assert plugin?","answer":"You can use the following rule to assert that the text condition equals \u0027Success\u0027:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:Text --Operator:Equal --Expected:Success}}\",\n  \"onElement\": \"{{$Get-Parameter --Name:MyParam --Scope:Session}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Assert\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What rule would I use to assert that an alert exists?","answer":"To assert that an alert exists, you can use this rule:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:AlertExists}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Assert\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do I assert that the text of an element identified by a CSS selector matches a regular expression?","answer":"You can assert that the text of an element identified by the CSS selector \u0027#greeting\u0027 matches the regular expression \u0027^Hello.*\u0027 with the following rule:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementText --Operator:Match --Expected:^Hello.*}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#greeting\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Assert\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I do not provide a mandatory parameter like \u0027Condition\u0027?","answer":"If the mandatory parameter \u0027Condition\u0027 is not provided, the Assert plugin will not be able to perform the validation, and an error will be raised indicating that the required parameter is missing."},{"question":"Can I use Xpath to locate an element for assertion? If so, how?","answer":"Yes, you can use Xpath to locate an element. For example, to assert that the text of an element located by Xpath \u0027//div[@id=\"message\"]\u0027 equals \u0027Hello World\u0027, you would use:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementText --Operator:Equal --Expected:Hello World}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"Xpath\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//div[@id=\u0027message\u0027]\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Assert\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the \u0027OnAttribute\u0027 property in the Assert plugin?","answer":"The \u0027OnAttribute\u0027 property specifies which attribute of the target element will be the focus of the validation or manipulation. This allows you to assert conditions based on specific attributes rather than the entire element."},{"question":"How does the \u0027Timeout\u0027 parameter affect the behavior of the Assert plugin?","answer":"The \u0027Timeout\u0027 parameter specifies how long the Assert plugin should wait for the expected condition to be met before failing the assertion. A longer timeout allows for more time for the condition to be satisfied, while a shorter timeout may lead to premature failures."},{"question":"What are some common locator strategies for mobile native plugins?","answer":"Common locator strategies for mobile native plugins include MobileElementResourceId, MobileElementName, and MobileElementAccessibilityId. For example, to assert that a button with the resource ID \u0027com.example:id/submit\u0027 is displayed, you could use:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Condition:ElementDisplayed}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"MobileElementResourceId\",\n  \"onElement\": \"com.example:id/submit\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Assert\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How can I use the \u0027RegularExpression\u0027 property in an assertion?","answer":"The \u0027RegularExpression\u0027 property allows you to apply a regex pattern to validate or extract specific information.
