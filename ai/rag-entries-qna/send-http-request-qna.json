{"id":"SendHttpRequestQnA","resource_id":"SendHttpRequestQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How do I send a default GET request using the SendHttpRequest plugin?","answer":"You can send a default GET request to a specified API endpoint like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/find\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How can I include headers in my HTTP request?","answer":"You can include headers by specifying them in the argument. For example, to send an HTTP GET request with an Authorization header, use:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Url:http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/connect --Header:Authorization=Basic username:password}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I do not specify the HTTP method in my request?","answer":"If the HTTP method is not explicitly provided, the SendHttpRequest plugin defaults to a GET request."},{"question":"Can I send a POST request with a body and specific content type?","answer":"Yes, you can send a POST request with a body and content type. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Url:http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/headers --Method:POST --Body:{\\\"key\\\":\\\"value\\\"} --Header:ContentType=application/json}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do I handle dynamic parameters in my HTTP request?","answer":"You can use runtime parameters in your request. For instance, to include an Authorization header with a Bearer token, you can configure it like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Url: http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/headers --Header:Authorization=Bearer YourAccessToken --Header:ContentType=application/json}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the OnElement property?","answer":"The OnElement property is used to target elements using either XPath or JSONPath expressions, allowing you to handle different response formats appropriately."},{"question":"What should I do if I provide an invalid URL?","answer":"If you provide an invalid URL, the HTTP request will fail, and you will not receive a valid response. It\u0027s important to validate the URL before making the request."},{"question":"How can I extract specific data from the HTTP response?","answer":"You can use the RegularExpression property to define a regex pattern for extracting specific data from the response. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Url:http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/headers --RegularExpression:\\\"(.*)\\\"}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the significance of the ContentType parameter?","answer":"The ContentType parameter specifies the type of data included in the body of the request, informing the server how to parse and handle the incoming data."},{"question":"Can I send multiple headers in a single request?","answer":"Yes, you can send multiple headers by using the syntax for key-value pairs. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Url:http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/headers --Header:header1name=value1 --Header:header2name=value2}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```"}],"text":"# SendHttpRequest Plugin QnA\n\n**How do I send a default GET request using the SendHttpRequest plugin?**  \nYou can send a default GET request to a specified API endpoint like this:  \n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"http://localhost:9002/api/hotels/find\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendHttpRequest\"\n}\n```\n\n**How can I include headers in my HTTP request?**  \nYou can include headers by specifying them in the argument.
