For example, to navigate back three steps with a 1000-millisecond delay, use:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Repeat:3 --Delay:1000}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"UndoNavigation\"\n}\n```\n\n**What happens if I specify a negative value for the Repeat parameter?**\n\nSpecifying a negative value for the Repeat parameter will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior, as the number of repetitions must be a positive integer.\n\n**Can I use the UndoNavigation plugin to handle errors by navigating back to a previous state?**\n\nYes, the UndoNavigation plugin can be utilized in error-handling mechanisms to navigate back to a known state before retrying actions.\n\n**What is the default value for the Delay parameter in the UndoNavigation plugin?**\n\nThe default value for the Delay parameter is `0`, meaning there will be no pause between navigation steps unless specified otherwise.\n\n**How can I configure the UndoNavigation plugin to navigate back three times with a one-second delay?**\n\nYou can configure the plugin with the following command:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Repeat:3 --Delay:00:00:01}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"UndoNavigation\"\n}\n```\n\n**What key properties can I use to customize the behavior of the UndoNavigation plugin?**\n\nYou can use the `Argument` key property to customize the behavior of the plugin by providing supplementary information or instructions.\n\n**What would happen if I omit the Delay parameter when using the UndoNavigation plugin?**\n\nIf you omit the Delay parameter, the plugin will execute the backward navigation without any pauses between the steps, which may lead to faster navigation but could affect the stability of the automation flow.\n\n**Can I use the UndoNavigation plugin in a multi-step automation process?**\n\nYes, the UndoNavigation plugin is designed to streamline automation scripts by automating backward navigation through multiple pages,
