{"id":"New-RandomNumberQnA","resource_id":"New-RandomNumberQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How can I generate a random integer value using the New-RandomNumber plugin?","answer":"You can generate a random integer value by using the New-RandomNumber plugin in your automation workflow. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#inputField\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$New-RandomNumber}}\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I do not specify the MinValue or MaxValue parameters?","answer":"If you do not specify the MinValue or MaxValue parameters, the plugin will use the default minimum and maximum values of the integer data type."},{"question":"Can I generate random floating-point numbers with the New-RandomNumber plugin?","answer":"Yes, you can generate random floating-point numbers by setting the NumberType parameter to \u0027Float\u0027 or \u0027Double\u0027. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"NumberType\": \"Float\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the argument field in the plugin usage?","answer":"The argument field is used to specify the generated random integer value. For instance, you can reference the generated number as `{{$New-RandomNumber}}`."},{"question":"How can I use the New-RandomNumber plugin for conditional logic in my automation workflow?","answer":"You can use the New-RandomNumber plugin to generate random values that can determine the flow of your automation. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"pluginName\": \"ConditionalBranch\",\n  \"condition\": \"{{$New-RandomNumber}} \u003e 50\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What locator strategies can I use with the New-RandomNumber plugin?","answer":"You can use various locator strategies such as Id, CssSelector, and Xpath. For example, using Xpath:\n```json\n{\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\",\n  \"locator\": \"Xpath\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//input[@id=\u0027inputField\u0027]\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$New-RandomNumber}}\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What will happen if I provide an invalid locator?","answer":"If you provide an invalid locator, the plugin will fail to find the target element, and the automation workflow will not execute the intended action."},{"question":"Can I use the New-RandomNumber plugin for data-driven testing?","answer":"Yes, the New-RandomNumber plugin is ideal for data-driven testing as it can generate random numbers to be used as test data inputs."},{"question":"How does the Timeout parameter affect the behavior of the New-RandomNumber plugin?","answer":"The Timeout parameter specifies how long the plugin should wait for the operation to complete. If the operation does not complete within the specified time, it may throw an error or fail."},{"question":"What is an example of using the New-RandomNumber plugin with MobileElementAccessibilityId?","answer":"You can use the New-RandomNumber plugin in mobile automation as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\",\n  \"locator\": \"MobileElementAccessibilityId\",\n  \"onElement\": \"inputField\",\n  \"argument\": \"{{$New-RandomNumber}}\"\n}\n```"}],"text":"# New-RandomNumber QnA\n\n**How can I generate a random integer value using the New-RandomNumber plugin?**  \nYou can generate a random integer value by using the New-RandomNumber plugin in your automation workflow.
