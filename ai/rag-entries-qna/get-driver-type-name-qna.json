{"id":"Get-DriverTypeNameQnA","resource_id":"Get-DriverTypeNameQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"What does the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin do?","answer":"The `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin retrieves the type name of the WebDriver instance used in automation workflows, providing valuable insight for customization and logging purposes."},{"question":"How can I log the WebDriver type name using the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?","answer":"You can log the WebDriver type name by using the following example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"WriteLog\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How can I use a regex pattern to extract a specific portion of the WebDriver type name?","answer":"You can specify a regex pattern to match a portion of the WebDriver type name like this:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:\\\"^Open\\\"}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"WriteLog\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I do not provide a regex pattern when using the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?","answer":"If you do not provide a regex pattern, the plugin will use the default pattern `(?s).*`, which matches the entire WebDriver type name."},{"question":"Can I customize automation actions based on the WebDriver type?","answer":"Yes, you can customize automation actions based on the WebDriver type to improve adaptability. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"Custom action for WebDriver type: {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"CustomAction\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What are some use cases for the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?","answer":"Some use cases include logging the WebDriver type for enhanced visibility, customizing automation actions based on the WebDriver type, and logging the WebDriver type during test execution for debugging."},{"question":"How does the Timeout parameter affect the behavior of the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?","answer":"The Timeout parameter determines how long the plugin will wait for the WebDriver type name to be retrieved before timing out. A longer timeout may be necessary in environments with slower response times."},{"question":"What locator strategies can I use with the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?","answer":"For general plugins, you can use Id, CssSelector, and Xpath. For example, using Xpath:\n```json\n{\n  \"locator\": \"//driver/type\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Get-DriverTypeName\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What should I do if I encounter an invalid locator when using the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?","answer":"If you encounter an invalid locator, the plugin will return an error indicating that the locator could not be found. Ensure that the locator is correctly specified and corresponds to an existing element."},{"question":"Can I use the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin in mobile automation?","answer":"Yes, in mobile automation, you can use locators such as MobileElementResourceId, MobileElementName, and MobileElementAccessibilityId. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"locator\": \"resourceId=app.package:id/driverType\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"Get-DriverTypeName\"\n}\n```"}],"text":"# Get-DriverTypeName QnA\n\n**What does the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin do?**  \nThe `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin retrieves the type name of the WebDriver instance used in automation workflows, providing valuable insight for customization and logging purposes.\n\n**How can I log the WebDriver type name using the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?**  \nYou can log the WebDriver type name by using the following example:  \n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"The type name of the WebDriver is {{$Get-DriverTypeName}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"WriteLog\"\n}\n```\n\n**How can I use a regex pattern to extract a specific portion of the WebDriver type name?**  \nYou can specify a regex pattern to match a portion of the WebDriver type name like this:  \n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"The matched pattern of the WebDriver type name is {{$Get-DriverTypeName --Pattern:\\\\\\\"^Open\\\\\\\"}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"WriteLog\"\n}\n```\n\n**What happens if I do not provide a regex pattern when using the `Get-DriverTypeName` plugin?**  \nIf you do not provide a regex pattern, the plugin will use the default pattern `(?s).*`, which matches the entire WebDriver type name.\n\n**Can I customize automation actions based on the WebDriver type?**  \nYes, you can customize automation actions based on the WebDriver type to improve adaptability.
