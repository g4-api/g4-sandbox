{"id":"Resolve-MathExpressionQnA","resource_id":"Resolve-MathExpressionQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How can I use the ResolveMathExpression plugin to calculate the sum of two numbers?","answer":"You can use the ResolveMathExpression plugin by specifying the X and Y parameters for the numbers you want to add. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$Resolve-MathExpression --X:5 --Y:10 --Operation:+}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \".result-field\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I forget to provide the mandatory parameters X or Y?","answer":"If you do not provide the mandatory parameters X or Y, the plugin will return an error indicating that these parameters are required for the mathematical operation to be performed."},{"question":"Can I sort the numbers before performing the calculation using the ResolveMathExpression plugin?","answer":"Yes, you can sort the numbers by using the Asc or Desc switches. For example, to sort in ascending order before adding:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$Resolve-MathExpression --X:10 --Y:5 --Operation:+ --Asc:true}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \".result-field\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How do I round the result of a mathematical operation using the ResolveMathExpression plugin?","answer":"You can round the result by using the Round parameter. For example, to round the result to 2 decimal places:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$Resolve-MathExpression --X:10.1234 --Y:5.5678 --Operation:+ --Round:2}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \".result-field\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the Abs switch in the ResolveMathExpression plugin?","answer":"The Abs switch instructs the plugin to return the absolute value of the result. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$Resolve-MathExpression --X:-10 --Y:5 --Operation:+ --Abs:true}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \".result-field\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"Can I use a regular expression pattern with the ResolveMathExpression plugin?","answer":"Yes, you can specify a regular expression pattern using the Pattern parameter to extract specific information from the result. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$Resolve-MathExpression --X:10 --Y:5 --Operation:+ --Pattern:\\d+}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \".result-field\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How does the ResolveMathExpression plugin handle invalid operations?","answer":"If you specify an invalid operation, the plugin will return an error indicating that the operation is not recognized. Ensure that you use valid operations such as +, -, *, /, etc."},{"question":"Can I use the ResolveMathExpression plugin in a dynamic automation workflow?","answer":"Yes, the ResolveMathExpression plugin is designed to be used in dynamic automation workflows, allowing you to calculate values based on changing conditions or input parameters."},{"question":"What locator strategies can I use with the ResolveMathExpression plugin?","answer":"You can use various locator strategies such as Id, CssSelector, and Xpath for general plugins. For example, using Xpath:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$Resolve-MathExpression --X:5 --Y:10 --Operation:+}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"Xpath\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//div[@class=\u0027result-field\u0027]\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeys\"\n}\n```"}],"text":"# Resolve-MathExpression QnA\n\n**How can I use the ResolveMathExpression plugin to calculate the sum of two numbers?**  \nYou can use the ResolveMathExpression plugin by specifying the X and Y parameters for the numbers you want to add.
