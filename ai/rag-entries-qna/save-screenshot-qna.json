It can be set to various strategies such as Id, CssSelector, or Xpath."},{"question":"What happens if I use an invalid locator when trying to capture a screenshot?","answer":"If an invalid locator is used, the plugin will not be able to find the specified element, and the screenshot capture will fail, potentially returning an error message."},{"question":"Can I capture screenshots for visual regression testing?","answer":"Yes, the SaveScreenshot plugin is ideal for visual regression testing as it allows you to capture screenshots during different test runs to detect unexpected visual changes."},{"question":"How can I ensure that screenshots are saved with unique filenames to avoid overwrites?","answer":"You can save screenshots in a specified directory without a filename, allowing the plugin to generate unique filenames automatically. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Directory:Screenshots}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SaveScreenshot\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the significance of the OnElement property?","answer":"The OnElement property specifies the target HTML element for which a screenshot will be captured.
