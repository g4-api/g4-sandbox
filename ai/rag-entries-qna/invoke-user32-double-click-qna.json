{"id":"InvokeUser32DoubleClickQnA","resource_id":"InvokeUser32DoubleClickQnA","qa_pairs":[{"question":"How do I perform a double-click action at specific coordinates?","answer":"You can perform a double-click action at specific coordinates by using the following rule:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:100 --Y:200}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"InvokeUser32DoubleClick\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the OffsetX and OffsetY parameters?","answer":"The OffsetX and OffsetY parameters specify the horizontal and vertical offsets (in pixels) to adjust the double-click position relative to the target element. They are optional and default to 0."},{"question":"Can I perform a double-click on a specific UI element?","answer":"Yes, you can perform a double-click on a specific UI element by specifying the OnElement property with its XPath. For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --OffsetX:10 --OffsetY:20 --Alignment:TopLeft}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"Xpath\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//button[@id=\u0027SubmitButton\u0027]\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"InvokeUser32DoubleClick\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What happens if I do not provide a target element for the double-click?","answer":"If no target element is provided, the plugin will perform a double-click at the specified coordinates (X, Y). For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:150 --Y:250}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"InvokeUser32DoubleClick\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What alignment options are available for the double-click action?","answer":"The alignment options include \u0027MiddleCenter\u0027, \u0027TopLeft\u0027, and others that best fit your UI layout. For example, to double-click at the center of the element, you would use:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Alignment:MiddleCenter}}\",\n  \"onElement\": \"//div[@class=\u0027example\u0027]\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"InvokeUser32DoubleClick\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What will happen if I provide an invalid XPath in the OnElement property?","answer":"If an invalid XPath is provided in the OnElement property, the plugin will fail to locate the target element and the double-click action will not be executed."},{"question":"How does the Timeout parameter affect the plugin\u0027s behavior?","answer":"The Timeout parameter specifies how long the plugin will wait for the target element to be available before executing the double-click action. If the element is not found within the specified timeout, the action will fail."},{"question":"Can I use this plugin for UI testing?","answer":"Yes, this plugin is designed for UI testing by simulating user interactions, such as double-click actions on native UI components."},{"question":"What is the default locator strategy for this plugin?","answer":"The default locator strategy for this plugin is \u0027Xpath\u0027. You can specify the locator in the rule if needed."}],"text":"# InvokeUser32DoubleClick QnA\n\n**How do I perform a double-click action at specific coordinates?**  \nYou can perform a double-click action at specific coordinates by using the following rule:  \n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --X:100 --Y:200}}\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"InvokeUser32DoubleClick\"\n}\n```\n\n**What is the purpose of the OffsetX and OffsetY parameters?**  \nThe OffsetX and OffsetY parameters specify the horizontal and vertical offsets (in pixels) to adjust the double-click position relative to the target element.
