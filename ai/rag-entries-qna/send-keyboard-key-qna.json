For example, to add a 4000 milliseconds delay:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Key:Enter --Key:Backspace --Delay:4000}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#KeyboardKeyOutcome\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeyboardKey\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"What is the purpose of the \u0027Clear\u0027 parameter in the SendKeyboardKey plugin?","answer":"The \u0027Clear\u0027 parameter ensures that the content of the input field is emptied before sending any keyboard actions.

Always ensure that this parameter is included."},{"question":"How can I locate an element using Xpath instead of CSS selector?","answer":"You can specify the locator as Xpath.

For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Key:Enter}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"MobileElementResourceId\",\n  \"onElement\": \"com.example:id/keyboard_key_outcome\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeyboardKey\"\n}\n```"},{"question":"How does the \u0027Delay\u0027 parameter affect the behavior of the plugin?","answer":"The \u0027Delay\u0027 parameter introduces a pause between key presses, making the interaction more human-like. For example, a delay of 2000 milliseconds can be added as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Key:Enter --Delay:2000}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#KeyboardKeyOutcome\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeyboardKey\"\n}\n```"}],"text":"# SendKeyboardKey QnA\n\n**How can I simulate pressing the \u0027Enter\u0027 key on an element using a CSS selector?**  \nYou can use the following configuration:  \n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"Enter\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#KeyboardKeyOutcome\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeyboardKey\"\n}\n```\n\n**What happens if I want to simulate pressing multiple keys, such as \u0027Enter\u0027 followed by \u0027Backspace\u0027?**  \nYou can specify multiple keys in the argument like this:  \n```json\n{\n  \"argument\": \"{{$ --Key:Enter --Key:Backspace}}\",\n  \"locator\": \"CssSelector\",\n  \"onElement\": \"#KeyboardKeyOutcome\",\n  \"pluginName\": \"SendKeyboardKey\"\n}\n```\n\n**How do I introduce a delay between key presses?**  \nYou can add a delay parameter to your configuration.
