I want to start a new project
this project involves of refactor and normalize large manifest files to be suitable for RAG
manifest file is a json file that describes a plugin
each plugin is a part of G4 API Automation Engine
each plugin is a component that invokes a single automation operation for example, click, send keys, send http request, etc.
manifests have many fields to describe the plugins they represent
all the plugins are the same object and have the same manifest schema
there are different plugin types. The plugin type is represented in the field pluginType in the manifest

can you help me with this project?
