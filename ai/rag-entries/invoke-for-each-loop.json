{"id":"InvokeForEachLoop","resource_id":"InvokeForEachLoop","metadata":{"plugin_key":"InvokeForEachLoop","aliases":[],"summary":"The `InvokeForEachLoop` plugin enables efficient iteration over elements identified by a specified locator. It allows automation scripts to execute a series of actions on each element sequentially, supporting complex workflows with nested loops. Key use cases include data processing, dynamic UI interactions in RPA, and comprehensive automation testing scenarios.","description":"The `InvokeForEachLoop` plugin is a powerful tool designed for both Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and automation testing. Its primary function is to locate multiple elements using a specified locator, iterate through each found element, and execute a predefined collection of actions on them. By default, actions are performed on the located elements, but the plugin also offers the flexibility to specify an alternative locator for action execution.
