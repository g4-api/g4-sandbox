This plugin is essential for quality assurance and RPA processes, allowing users to take snapshots of the application\u0027s state at specific points in the automation workflow, providing visual confirmation and aiding in debugging. Key features include capturing screenshots of the entire page or specific elements, specifying custom directories and filenames for saved screenshots, and generating unique filenames to avoid overwrites. In RPA, it is used for verification and documentation, capturing screenshots at critical steps to ensure the application\u0027s interface matches the expected state and providing a visual record for comprehensive reports. In automation testing, it supports visual regression testing, cross-browser testing, and historical tracking. It captures screenshots during different test runs to detect unexpected visual changes, ensures consistent rendering across various browsers, and creates a historical timeline of the application\u0027s behavior for deeper analysis.","key_parameters":{"parameters":[{"default":".","description":"The directory or folder where the screenshot captured by the `SaveScreenshot` plugin will be saved.
