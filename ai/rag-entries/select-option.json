Key features include element validation, multiple selection methods, and robust error handling.","description":"The `SelectOption` plugin serves the purpose of automating the selection of options within `\u003cselect\u003e` elements on web pages. Its primary goal is to streamline and automate the process of interacting with dropdown menus, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of web-based tasks in RPA and automation testing scenarios. The plugin validates that the targeted element is indeed a `\u003cselect\u003e` element before attempting the selection operation, ensuring that the automation process is applied only to appropriate elements. It provides flexibility by offering various methods to select options, including by index, value, partial text, or exact text match. This versatility accommodates different use cases and scenarios encountered in RPA and automation testing workflows. The plugin incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to capture and handle exceptions that may arise during the selection process, enhancing the reliability and resilience of automation workflows.","key_parameters":{},"key_properties":{"Argument":{"description":"The `Argument` property specifies the value that the plugin will use to select an option from a dropdown menu.
