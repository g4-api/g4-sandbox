{"id":"SendKeys","resource_id":"SendKeys","metadata":{"plugin_key":"SendKeys","aliases":[],"summary":"The `SendKeys` plugin automates the sending of text inputs to specified elements, simulating user interactions for web automation and testing. It supports dynamic text entry, clearing input fields, using modifier keys, and introducing delays between inputs for accurate simulation of user behavior.","description":"### Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the `SendKeys` plugin is to provide automation scripts with the capability to send text inputs to specified elements. This is particularly important in scenarios where user interactions involve input fields, requiring precise control over text entry to simulate user behavior. The plugin aims to streamline automation workflows by facilitating seamless text inputs.\n\n### Key Features and Functionality\n\n| Feature               | Description                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dynamic Configuration | Supports dynamic configuration through parameters such as `Keys`, `Delay`, `Clear`, and `NativeClear`.     |\n| Robust Error Handling | Includes mechanisms for handling exceptions, ensuring reliable execution of text inputs.                   |\n| Modifier Keys Support | Allows sending text with modifier keys such as `Shift`, `Ctrl`, or `Alt` for complex text entry scenarios. |\n\n### Usage in RPA\n\n| Usage                 | Description                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Filling Forms         | Enables RPA processes to simulate user-like text entries, such as filling out forms or entering data into web elements.   |\n| Data Entry Automation | Helps in automating data entry tasks, ensuring that text is accurately entered into input fields, reducing manual effort. |\n| Triggering Events     | Triggers keyboard events such as `input`, `change`, and `keydown` events, simulating user interactions with the page.     |\n\n### Usage in Automation Testing\n\n| Usage                     | Description                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Form Field Testing        | Allows dynamic control of text inputs, leading to more thorough test coverage in scenarios involving text input fields.                        |\n| UI Stability Verification | Ensures that the user interface remains stable after text inputs for accurate validation of input handling by the application.                 |\n| Event Handling Testing    | Verifies that keyboard events are properly triggered and handled by the application, ensuring comprehensive testing of event-driven behaviors.","key_parameters":{"Clear":{"description":"Indicates that a clearing action will consistently be executed before any subsequent text inputs on the targeted input element.
