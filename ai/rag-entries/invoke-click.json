It can perform simple clicks as well as conditional clicks where the action is retried until a specified condition is met. This makes it highly versatile for automation tasks that require interaction with dynamic web elements.","description":"The primary purpose of the `InvokeClick` plugin is to perform click actions on specified web elements. It supports conditional clicks, allowing the action to be retried until a specified condition is met or a timeout occurs.\n\nKey features include support for various locator strategies, handling dynamic content, performing conditional clicks with customizable timeout and polling intervals, and ensuring robust interaction with web elements.\n\nIn RPA, it is used for automating user interactions such as form submissions, modal handling, and navigation through multi-step processes. The pluginâ??s ability to handle conditional actions ensures that workflows can adapt based on the state of web elements, improving reliability and flexibility.\n\nIn automation testing, it is invaluable for verifying user interface interactions, testing dynamic behaviors, and ensuring that click functionalities remain consistent across different versions of the application. The plugin supports detailed configuration options to handle complex testing scenarios, making it an essential tool for thorough UI testing.","key_parameters":{"Timeout":{"description":"Specifies the timeout duration in milliseconds for the click action.
