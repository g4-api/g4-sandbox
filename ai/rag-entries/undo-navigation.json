{"id":"UndoNavigation","resource_id":"UndoNavigation","metadata":{"plugin_key":"UndoNavigation","aliases":["NavigateBack"],"summary":"The `UndoNavigation` plugin automates the backward navigation in a web browser, allowing users to revisit previous pages or states.","description":"The primary purpose of the `UndoNavigation` plugin is to automate the process of navigating backward within a web browser. It provides a structured and configurable way to perform the `back` action, enabling automation scripts to simulate user interactions with precision. The plugin caters to scenarios where navigating back multiple steps with optional delays between actions is a requirement.\n\n### Key Features and Functionality\n\n| Feature             | Description                                                                                  |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dynamic Repeats     | Allows users to specify the number of times the browser should navigate back.                |\n| Configurable Delays | Users can introduce delays between each navigation step, enhancing the pluginâ??s flexibility. |\n| Intuitive Logging   | Logs a warning if the specified delay exceeds the maximum allowed value.                     |\n\n### Usages in RPA\n\n| Usage                | Description                                                                                      |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Multi-Step Processes | Streamlines automation scripts by automating backward navigation through multiple pages.         |\n| Error Handling       | Utilized in error-handling mechanisms to navigate back to a known state before retrying actions. |\n\n### Usages in Automation Testing\n\n| Usage                    | Description                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Browser State Management | Aids in managing the state of the browser during complex user journeys in automated test suites. |\n| Performance Testing      | Contributes to a more accurate representation of user behavior by controlling navigation delays.","key_parameters":{"Delay":{"default":"0","description":"Specifies the pause or waiting period between each step of the backward navigation process.
