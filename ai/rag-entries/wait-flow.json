Its primary objective is to pause the execution of an automation script until a specified condition is met or a timeout duration has elapsed. Key features include conditional waiting, timeout handling, and integration with assertion plugins for flexible and dynamic waiting logic. Common use cases include conditional flow control, timed delays, dynamic task management in RPA, waiting for element visibility, synchronization points, and handling asynchronous events in automation testing.","key_parameters":{"Condition":{"description":"Specifies the criteria or state that must be evaluated or met during the execution of a plugin or action.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Assertion"},"Expected":{"description":"Specifies the value or pattern that the automation script expects to find or match during the execution of a condition.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Any"},"Operator":{"description":"Specifies the type of comparison or operation to be performed when evaluating a condition.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Operator"},"Timeout":{"description":"Specifies the maximum duration the automation script should wait for a condition to be met before proceeding with the next step, after which it will terminate.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Number|Time"}},"key_properties":{"Argument":{"description":"Defines the duration to wait or the condition to evaluate, based on the type of wait specified.
