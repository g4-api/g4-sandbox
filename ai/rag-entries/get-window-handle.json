This functionality is crucial for managing and interacting with browser windows or tabs, enabling precise control over multi-window scenarios in browser-based automation tasks. Key Features and Functionality: Current Window Handle retrieves the unique identifier (handle) of the current browser window. Indexed Window Handle retrieves the window handle of a specific window or tab based on its index. Dynamic Window Handling facilitates switching and interacting with multiple windows or tabs using the retrieved window handle. Pattern Matching supports regex pattern matching to extract specific portions of the window handle if needed. Error Handling Support handles scenarios where the specified window handle is unavailable, ensuring robust workflows. Usages in RPA: Window Navigation navigate through web applications by identifying and interacting with specific browser windows or tabs. Data Extraction extract data from particular browser windows or tabs for processing in RPA workflows. Error Recovery handle scenarios where window interactions are disrupted, ensuring smooth continuation of RPA tasks. Usages in Automation Testing: Window Verification verify that expected windows or tabs are opened during test executions. Cross-Browser Testing manage window interactions effectively across multiple browsers. Parallel Testing enable simultaneous testing of multiple windows or tabs by accurately identifying and switching between them.","key_parameters":{"Index":{"description":"Specifies the index of the window handle to retrieve.
