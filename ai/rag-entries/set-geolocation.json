{"id":"SetGeolocation","resource_id":"SetGeolocation","metadata":{"plugin_key":"SetGeolocation","aliases":[],"summary":"The `SetGeolocation` plugin automates the process of setting the geolocation on a mobile device. In robotic process automation (RPA), it facilitates location-based automation by programmatically setting the deviceâ??s coordinates. In automation testing, it enables comprehensive testing of location-based features and ensures UI stability when the deviceâ??s location changes.","description":"The primary purpose of the `SetGeolocation` plugin is to allow automation scripts to set the geographical location of a mobile device. This functionality is essential in scenarios where location-based features or services need to be tested under various conditions. The plugin aims to streamline mobile automation by providing precise control over the deviceâ??s geolocation.\n\n### Key Features and Functionality\n\n| Feature              | Description                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Geolocation Control  | Allows setting the deviceâ??s latitude, longitude, and altitude, providing comprehensive control over its location.                     |\n| Compatibility Check  | Verifies if the WebDriver in use supports geolocation, ensuring the pluginâ??s functionality is invoked only in supported environments. |\n| Seamless Integration | Integrates with WebDriverâ??s geolocation capabilities, enabling precise configuration of the deviceâ??s location.                        |\n\n### Usages in RPA\n\n| Usage                     | Description                                                                                                       |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Location-Based Automation | Automates tasks that require the device to be at a specific location, such as testing location-based services.    |\n| Testing Geofencing        | Ensures that geofencing features trigger correctly by simulating the device entering or leaving predefined areas. |\n\n### Usages in Automation Testing\n\n| Usage                          | Description                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Comprehensive Location Testing | Enables testing of location-based features by setting the device to various coordinates and validating the applicationâ??s response. |\n| UI Stability Validation        | Ensures that the applicationâ??s UI remains stable and functions correctly when the deviceâ??s location changes.","key_parameters":{"Latitude":{"description":"The latitude coordinate to set for the deviceâ??s geolocation.
