{"id":"HideSoftKeyboard","resource_id":"HideSoftKeyboard","metadata":{"plugin_key":"HideSoftKeyboard","aliases":["HideKeyboard"],"summary":"The `HideSoftKeyboard` plugin automates the hiding of the on-screen keyboard on a mobile device.","description":"The primary purpose of the `HideSoftKeyboard` plugin is to provide automation scripts with the capability to hide the on-screen keyboard on a mobile device. This functionality is crucial in scenarios where user interactions involve input fields, and a clear view of the application\u0027s interface is required post-input. The plugin aims to optimize mobile automation flows by seamlessly managing the visibility of the on-screen keyboard. Allows dynamic configuration through a `HideKeyboardModel`, which includes parameters such as `key`, `key code`, `key name`, and `strategy`. This ensures precise control over how the keyboard is hidden based on specific automation scenarios. Verifies if the WebDriver in use supports hiding the keyboard as a mobile device, ensuring the plugin\u0027s functionality is invoked only in supported environments. Integrates with the `HideKeyboard` method if the WebDriver supports hiding the keyboard as a mobile device, enabling precise configuration for hiding the keyboard.","key_parameters":{"Strategy":{"description":"The method or strategy employed to hide the on-screen keyboard on a mobile device. It supports different strategies to accommodate variations in mobile platforms and environments.
