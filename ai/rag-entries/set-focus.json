{"id":"SetFocus","resource_id":"SetFocus","metadata":{"plugin_key":"SetFocus","aliases":[],"summary":"The `SetFocus` plugin automates the process of setting focus on specified web elements. It ensures that elements are focused before performing further interactions, which is crucial for form filling, interactive workflows, and event triggering in both RPA and automation testing scenarios.","description":"### Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the `SetFocus` plugin is to automate the process of setting focus on specific web elements. This functionality is crucial in scenarios where user interactions involve input fields or other elements that need to be active for subsequent actions. The plugin aims to streamline automation workflows by ensuring that the necessary elements are focused before further interactions.\n\n### Key Features and Functionality\n\n| Feature           | Description                                                                  |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Element Focusing  | Automates the process of setting focus on specified web elements.            |\n| Dynamic Targeting | Supports dynamic targeting of elements using various locators and selectors. |\n\n### Usages in RPA\n\n| Usage                   | Description                                                                                |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Form Filling Automation | Ensures input fields are focused before entering data, improving accuracy in form filling. |\n| Interactive Workflows   | Automates focus setting for elements in complex interactive workflows.                     |\n| Event Triggering        | Sets focus on elements to trigger associated events, such as onfocus or onblur events.     |\n\n### Usages in Automation Testing\n\n| Usage                       | Description                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UI Interaction Testing      | Verifies that elements can be focused programmatically, ensuring proper UI behavior.            |\n| Form Field Validation       | Ensures that input fields can be focused and interacted with during automated tests.            |\n| Event Handling Verification | Tests if focus-related events (e.g., onfocus, onblur) are correctly handled by the application.","key_parameters":{},"key_properties":{"Locator":{"default":"Xpath","description":"Specifies the strategy or method used to locate the element on which focus will be set.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"name":"Locator","values":[],"type":"String"},"OnElement":{"description":"Specifies the identifier or locator for the element on which the focus action will be performed.
