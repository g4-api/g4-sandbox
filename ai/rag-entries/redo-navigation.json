{"id":"RedoNavigation","resource_id":"RedoNavigation","metadata":{"plugin_key":"RedoNavigation","aliases":["NavigateForward"],"summary":"The `RedoNavigation` plugin automates the forward navigation in a web browser, allowing users to revisit previous pages or states. It offers options for specifying the number of repeats and introducing delays between steps for controlled navigation.","description":"### Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the `RedoNavigation` plugin is to automate the process of navigating forward within a web browser. It provides a structured and configurable way to perform the `forward` action, enabling automation scripts to simulate user interactions with precision. The plugin caters to scenarios where navigating forward multiple steps with optional delays between actions is a requirement.\n\n### Key Features and Functionality\n\n| Feature             | Description                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dynamic Repeats     | Allows specifying the number of times the browser should navigate forward, adapting to various automation needs.           |\n| Configurable Delays | Introduces delays between each navigation step, enhancing flexibility and preventing interference with web responsiveness. |\n| Intuitive Logging   | Incorporates logging capabilities, providing insights and transparency into the execution process.                         |\n\n### Usages in RPA\n\n| Usage                | Description                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Multi-Step Processes | Streamlines multi-step workflows that involve navigating through multiple pages.                                 |\n| Error Handling       | Navigates forward to a known state for retrying or taking alternative actions if certain conditions are not met. |\n\n### Usages in Automation Testing\n\n| Usage                    | Description                                                                           |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Browser State Management | Manages the state of the browser in end-to-end tests involving complex user journeys. |\n| Performance Testing      | Simulates realistic user interactions with controlled navigation forward and delays.  |","key_parameters":{"Delay":{"default":"0","description":"Specifies the pause or waiting period between each step of the forward navigation process.
