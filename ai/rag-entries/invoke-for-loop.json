{"id":"InvokeForLoop","resource_id":"InvokeForLoop","metadata":{"plugin_key":"InvokeForLoop","aliases":[],"summary":"The `InvokeForLoop` plugin enables efficient and controlled iteration over a predefined set of actions within automation scripts.","description":"The `InvokeForLoop` plugin serves as a fundamental tool in both Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and automation testing contexts. Its primary objective is to enable efficient and controlled iteration over a predefined set of actions within automation scripts, providing a flexible solution for handling repetitive tasks with a specified number of iterations. Key Features and Functionality: Controlled Iteration allows for controlled iteration over a series of actions, executing a predefined number of iterations as specified by the user. Sequential Execution executes actions sequentially within the loop, ensuring orderly and predictable execution of tasks. Parameterized Iteration employs parameterized iteration to dynamically control loop variables based on changing conditions or input values, enhancing adaptability and flexibility in RPA solutions. Usages in RPA include Data Processing, Batch Processing, and Parameterized Iteration. Usages in Automation Testing include Test Case Iteration, Data-Driven Testing, and Load Testing.","key_parameters":{},"key_properties":{"Argument":{"description":"Specifies the number of iterations the loop will execute.
