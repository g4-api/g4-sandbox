Its primary objective is to enable dynamic and repetitive execution of actions within automation scripts, providing a versatile solution for handling iterative tasks based on specified conditions. Key features include dynamic iteration, conditional execution, timeout handling, and seamless integration with the automation framework for extraction and performance point synchronization. Use cases include data validation, dynamic process automation, conditional flow control, dynamic testing, repetitive task automation, and conditional flow testing, ensuring robust and adaptable automation solutions.","key_parameters":{"Condition":{"description":"Specifies the criteria or state that must be evaluated or met during the execution of a plugin or action.","mandatory":true,"multiple":false,"type":"Assertion"},"Expected":{"description":"Specifies the value or pattern that the automation script expects to find or match during the execution of a condition.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Any"},"Operator":{"description":"Specifies the type of comparison or operation to be performed when evaluating a condition.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Operator"},"Timeout":{"description":"Specifies the maximum duration the automation script should wait for a condition to be met before proceeding with the next step, after which it will terminate.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"Number|Time"}},"key_properties":{"Argument":{"description":"Defines a condition or criteria that guides the behavior of a plugin during execution.","mandatory":true,"multiple":false,"type":"Expression"},"Locator":{"default":"Xpath","description":"Specifies how elements should be located on a webpage or within an application.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"String"},"OnAttribute":{"description":"Specifies the attribute of the target element that will be interacted with or evaluated during automation.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"String"},"OnElement":{"description":"Specifies the target element on which conditions will be evaluated during the automation process.","mandatory":false,"multiple":false,"type":"String"},"Rules":{"description":"Define a sequence of actions or instructions to be executed within a loop or under specific conditions.","mandatory":true,"multiple":false,"type":"Array"}},"output_parameters":{},"use_cases":["Data Validation","Dynamic Process Automation","Conditional Flow Control","Dynamic Testing","Repetitive Task Automation","Conditional Flow Testing"],"version":"1.0","clstype":"Action"},"examples":[{"description":"Iteratively click the `Next` button until a specific condition, checking for the presence of the word `active` in the `class` attribute of a designated button element, is met.
