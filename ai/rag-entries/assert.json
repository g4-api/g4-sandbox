{"id":"Assert","resource_id":"Assert","metadata":{"plugin_key":"Assert","aliases":[],"summary":"The `Assert` plugin automates the validation of expected conditions during the execution of automation scripts, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of automated processes.","description":"The `Assert` plugin is a crucial component in the world of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and automation testing. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the validation of expected conditions during the execution of automation scripts. By asserting specific conditions, it ensures that the application or system under test behaves as anticipated, contributing to the overall reliability and accuracy of automated processes. Key features include data extraction, dynamic assertion handling, and exception handling, capturing and managing context information and supporting data extractions. Common use cases include process validation, error handling, and logging in RPA, as well as functional testing, regression testing, and data validation in automation testing.","key_parameters":{"Condition":{"description":"Serves as a dynamic specifier for the type of validation or verification to be executed in automation rules. This parameter is particularly noteworthy for its adaptability, as its available values are dynamically generated based on the plugins of type `Assertion` within G4â?¢ engine. The `Condition` parameter allows the rule to express various types of assertions or conditions dynamically. These dynamic conditions are derived from the plugins of type `Assertion` available in the G4â?¢ framework. Each assertion plugin contributes unique conditions, reflecting diverse validation scenarios. As new assertion plugins are introduced or existing ones are updated, the `Condition` parameter seamlessly incorporates these changes. This ensures that automation rules remain adaptable and can leverage the latest assertion capabilities without requiring explicit modifications to the rule structures.","mandatory":true,"multiple":false,"name":"Condition","type":"Assertion"},"Expected":{"description":"Defines the value or condition that the automation rule expects to encounter or validate.

This parameter is particularly noteworthy for its adaptability, as its available values are dynamically generated based on the plugins of type `Operator` within G4â?¢ engine. The `Operator` parameter dynamically incorporates values based on plugins of type `Operator` within the automation framework.
