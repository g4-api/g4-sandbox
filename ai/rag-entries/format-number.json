This signifies the action of sending keystrokes to an element.\n- **argument**: Specifies the number and format to be used for formatting. For example, `{{$Format-Number --Number:123456789.12345678 --Format:R}}`.\n- **locator**: Specifies the locator mechanism to identify the target element. For example, `CssSelector`.\n- **onElement**: Specifies the value of the locator mechanism used to identify the target element.

This format is supported only for the Half, Single, Double, and BigInteger types. For both Double and Single values, the `R` format specifier offers relatively poor performance. We recommend using the `G17` format specifier for Double values and the `G9` format specifier to successfully round-trip Single values. When a BigInteger value is formatted using this specifier, its string representation contains all the significant digits. Although you can include a precision specifier, it is ignored, and round trips take precedence over precision.
