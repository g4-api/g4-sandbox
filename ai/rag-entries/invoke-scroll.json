{"id":"InvokeScroll","resource_id":"InvokeScroll","metadata":{"plugin_key":"InvokeScroll","aliases":["Scroll"],"summary":"The `InvokeScroll` plugin automates scrolling actions on web pages, enabling precise control over vertical and horizontal scrolling within web pages or specific elements. It supports a variety of scrolling behaviors, making it an essential tool for both robotic process automation (RPA) and automation testing scenarios where interaction with off-screen elements or dynamic content is required.","description":"### Purpose\n\nThe primary purpose of the `InvokeScroll` plugin is to automate scrolling actions on web pages. In both RPA and automation testing, interacting with web pages often involves scrolling to view hidden or off-screen elements, simulate user behavior, or verify the appearance of elements at different scroll positions. This plugin provides a mechanism to perform such scrolling actions programmatically as part of automated workflows or tests.\n\n### Key Features and Functionality\n\n| Feature       | Description                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scalability   | The plugin can handle scrolling for both specific elements and entire pages, making it versatile for various automation scenarios.            |\n| Customization | It allows customization of scrolling behavior by accepting arguments such as behavior type (smooth, auto, etc.), left offset, and top offset. |\n| Reusable      | The plugin encapsulates scrolling logic into reusable components, reducing code duplication and enhancing maintainability.                    |\n| Reliability   | By leveraging JavaScript-based scrolling, the plugin ensures reliable scrolling behavior across different web browsers and environments.      |\n\n### Usages in RPA\n\n| Usage                | Description                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Data Extraction      | Scrolling through web pages to extract relevant data from tables, lists, or grids.                          |\n| Silent Paging        | Navigating through paginated content to collect comprehensive datasets.                                     |\n| Multi-Step Workflows | Automating scrolling actions as part of broader RPA processes to navigate through multi-step workflows.     |\n| Forms \u0026 Data        | Completing forms or interacting with web-based applications that require scrolling beyond the initial view. |\n\n### Usages in Automation Testing\n\n| Usage                        | Description                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Responsive Design Testing    | Simulate scrolling actions on different screen sizes and devices, ensuring application responsiveness across various viewport dimensions. |\n| Accessibility Testing        | Scroll through web pages and verify the accessibility of interactive elements for individuals with disabilities.                          |\n| Automation Test Scripts      | Integrate scrolling actions into automated test scripts to interact with dynamic web elements effectively.                                |\n| Infinite Scroll Handling     | Automate scrolling to test and validate the functionality of infinite scroll features during automated testing.                           |\n| Visual Testing               | Scroll through web pages and capture screenshots for visual regression testing.                                                           |\n| Dynamic Content Verification | Automate scrolling actions to verify the presence and behavior of dynamically loaded content during automated tests.","key_parameters":{"Behavior":{"description":"Specifies the scrolling behavior.
